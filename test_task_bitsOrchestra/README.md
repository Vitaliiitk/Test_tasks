The main idea of the project was to create a .NET WEB application that allows users to upload a CSV file, store data into MS SQL database,
show data on the page.

Additionally was added a fitration by marital status, sorting by any field. Also, the WEB app provides inline editing for any row with a possibility
to remove a record from the database. Also, added validation for fields Name, Phone, and Salary.

To test the functionality of the app you need to download the project. In the project's folder, there are backup of the Microsoft SQL database
(DataDb.bak) and the CSV file with persons, that I used to test the app (testPersons.csv).
